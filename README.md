circuit-simulator-2.0
=================

This is a version forked from the improvement available at <https://github.com/fmselab/circuit-simulator> starting from <http://www.falstad.com/circuit/>. The improvements made with this fork are the following:

* refactored the code structure, by adding packages and correcting the visibility of classes and fields
* now it is possible to integrate the circuit-simulator in other projects since the simulation can be performed even without GUI interaction
* resistors with value 0 are not usable anymore, since they led to exceptions due to division by zero. The default value for null resistors is now 1E-6
* circuit simulation can be now performed step by step by using the method loopAndContinue(false) of the class CirSim
* the project can now be used as an Eclipse project

For more information about how to compile, build and run the simulator, see the original repository at <https://github.com/fmselab/circuit-simulator>.
